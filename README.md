- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ravithakur-projects
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a Lead Design engineer at a startup named Lab Automate Technologies Inc. with 2+ years of work experience. I'm into pharmaceutical machine automation, research, and developing new concepts. I'm looking forward to gaining knowledge and practical experience in the future-driven field of robotics and autonomous technology. I would like to do post-graduation to pursue my passion and push my knowledge to a new level. As one of the emerging fields with lots of opportunities, Robotics can be the best opportunity to thrive in the research and development of autonomous systems.
